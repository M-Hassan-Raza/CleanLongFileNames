# CleanLongFileNames
## A simple BASH script I wrote to clean up lengthy names of downloaded files

So there's not much to say here. I download a lot of images, usually scrape them from websites, and those files have lengthy gibbersih names. So to solve the issue of my Downloads folder looking like an absolue garbage truck, I wrote this small script that replaces lengthy file names with simple numbers.
